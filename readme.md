<br>
<br>
Step 2: Open one new terminal type `cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar` in it and click enter
<br>
<br>
Step 3: Forward Port 25565 and make port 25565 Public and the link next to it is your server ip 
<br>
<br>
Step 4: replace "https://" with "wss://" 
<br>
<br>
Step 5 (Optional): to add plugins go to server>plugins and upload them there and then restart your server with `stop` then `sudo java -jar server.jar`  
<br>

Note: Remember this server is free and so it is not going to be online 24/7 or lag free so i recommend installing the plugin "Clear Lag" which automatically clears entitys
